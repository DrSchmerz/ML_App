Objective: To develop an application that helps identify potential indicators of dyslexia in children by analyzing handwritten schoolwork for recurring spelling and grammar errors.

The app uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract handwritten text from uploaded images and analyzes it to detect common error patterns associated with dyslexia. By allowing users (e.g., teachers or parents) to upload multiple samples over time, the app can track progress, visualize difficulties, and estimate the likelihood of dyslexia.
